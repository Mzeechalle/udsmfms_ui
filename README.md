# UDSM Files Management System for Enhancing Information Workflow

UDSM has manual system for movements of files and documents (e.g letters) between lower units (e.g departments) and 
higher organs of the University. Our six-month survey from UDSM Staff and Students shows that this system is inefficient, 
causing unnecessary delays for processing files and documents and for delivering responses to Students, or
other groups of people. The survey revealed that some important documents were misplaced during movements or processing. 
This project addresses these challenges to enhance
the overall workflow of information. The project can impact the UDSM commuity, and may
be customized to suit the demands from other universities or public
and private institutions.
